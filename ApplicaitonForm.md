# Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)

Our team loves [burner wallet](https://xdai.io) for its usability and xDai’s fast transaction.
**But** there is a lack of privacy, each vendor whom I pay can see the history of my transactions. Luckily we can solve this issue with zkSNARKs!

We are bringing privacy to [burner wallet](https://xdai.io) (all fincitonality impemented directly in [Burner wallet fork](https://github.com/poma/burner-wallet) and DAI infrastructure with confidential micropayments. :sunglasses:

### Usage:
- open Burner wallet fork by link: zdai.io :iphone:
- Exchange xDAI to zDAI :currency_exchange:
- Send confidetial private transaction :arrow_heading_up:
- ... ( take a cup of ☕️, while zkSNARK proof calculating approx 1 minute)
- Profit! :tada:
